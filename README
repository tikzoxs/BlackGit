T-Counting

Dependencies :
Python 3
OpenCV
Numpy

Small game to induce focus
Used in research to put the user in an attentive state in a single focus point to take sensory data.

Task is to count the number of screens with upright "T"s.
Each color change indicates a screen change. 
So it means, if the 'T' stays the same while background color changes, it counts as a new screen
At the end, after the screen changing stops, use only the linear number pad at the top of any keyboard to enter the count
The score will be displayed in the terminal

Time

Standard screen based game to induce stress
Used in research

Extract files from the stroop_data folder and put it into the same folder which has stroop.py

Task is to identify the COLOR OF THE TEXT. Meaning of the text is irrelevant 

If the Color of the text is RED, press ‘R’
If the Color of the text is GREEN, press ‘G’
If the Color of the text is BLUE, press ‘B’
If the Color of the text is YELLOW, press ‘Y’

Response time is measured from the moment the text is displayed to the moment you press the key

You won’t be notified whether the answer is correct. Next text will be displayed after a second. 

Mistakes have higher impact on the score than the response time

There is no maximum attainable score limit. The faster you are without any mistakes, the more you get

Average score is about 11

Tip to play: 
Place your middle finger of the left hand on ‘R’ key
Place your index finger of the left hand on ‘G’ key
Place your middle finger of the right hand on ‘Y’ key
Place your index finger of the right hand on ‘B’ key
