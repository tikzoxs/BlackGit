Small game to induce focus
Used in research to put the user in an attentive state in a single focus point to take sensory data.

Task is to count the number of screens with upright "T"s.
Each color change indicates a screen change. 
So it means, if the 'T' stays the same while background color changes, it counts as a new screen
At the end, after the screen changing stops, use only the linear number pad at the top of any keyboard to enter the count
The score will be displayed in the terminal
